        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>While a little time-consuming at first, these come together quickly once you get the hang of them. Use any flavor pie filling you prefer, but chop any large fruit pieces to make the wontons easier to stuff. Perfect for a crowd! You can make them in the air fryer or the oven.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and blueberries together in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
            <li>To make a wonton, place a heaping teaspoon of mixture in the center of a wonton wrapper. Dip your finger in water and run along the edges of the wrapper. Bring the bottom point of the wrapper to the top point to form a triangle. Press to seal. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 375 degrees.</li>
            <li>Fry wontons, in batches if necessary. Use a slotted spoon to remove the wontons to a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Allow to cool. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
